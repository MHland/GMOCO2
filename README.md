## Introduction
This is the data sharing module for the submitted article --- “Global models overestimate streamflow induced by rising CO<sub>2</sub>”, and a more detailed description of the data and codes is given here for review and exchange with reviewers and interested research stakeholders.

## Read me.pdf

All the details are in the file named **Read me.pdf**.

<br/>

## !!! Please be very careful before running the code !!!

The file **CO2_trend.rar** in folder **dataset** must be unpacked into the folder **dataset** before the code can run smoothly (The unpacked file name is:  **CO2_trend.nc**), this is because the large file **CO2_trend.nc** before packing exceeded the limit and we had to pack it.

<br/>

## We provided original annual streamflow dataset

Annual observed streamflow, annual precipitation, annual potential evapotranspiration, and annual land type data are available for the 1116 catchments (in **streamflow dataset/Yearly_streamflow_dataset.rar**, please unpack before use).
