## We provided original annual streamflow dataset

Annual observed streamflow, annual precipitation, annual potential evapotranspiration, and annual land type data are available for the 1116 catchments (in **dataset/small catchments/Yearly_streamflow_dataset.rar**, please unpack before use).

Annual observed streamflow data information is available for 44 large bains (in **dataset/large basins/large basins infor.xlsx**)

Other data, including: results for observation-constrained models, results of the regularized optimal fingerprinting method, and detailed results of the full discretization method for small basins are given, as detailed in **dataset/**, where **read me**, for a detailed description.
